# EEE3088F_PROJECT_POWER_MODULE
Our project involves designing and manufacturing the power module for the MM.  The processor, motherboard, and sensing modules have already been designed, so this directory will specifically focus on the design of four functions of the power module, which are to
handle bidirectional motor control, provide External load switching for the mm, voltage regulation and provide an ON/OFF switch for the robot
