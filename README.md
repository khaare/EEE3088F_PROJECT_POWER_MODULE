# EEE3088F_PROJECT_POWER_MODULE
The project involves designing and manufacturing the Micromouse(MM) power module.
This repo has two branches. One for Khaarendiwe and the other for Joshua.
It was made so because we worked on different parts of the design, focusing on
different requirements and specification.

The final design schematic and pcb are under the Main folder
