# EEE3088F_PROJECT_POWER_MODULE
The project involves designing and manufacturing the Micromouse(MM) power module.
This repo has two more branches. One for Khaarendiwe and the other for Joshua.
These branches were separated because we worked on different parts of the design, focusing on
different requirements and specifications.

The final design schematic and PCB are under the Main PCB folder, and the folder submitted is under the Submission #1 folder
