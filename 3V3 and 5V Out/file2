steps to do this

I will need a voltage regulator or
a boost and buck converter - these do that the boost converter will up the voltage(e.g 3.7 V to 5V) and the buck converter will
down the voltage (e.g 3.7V to 3v3)

Done. What is left is calculating the values

The price used for this part
TPS61022 - $0.51
XL1509 - $0.23
Resistors - $0.03 x 2
Capacitors - $0.03 x 3
Pol Capacitors - pending
Inductors - $0.11 x 2
Total = $1.91(without pol)
